# Two-way-commincation-with-speech-impaired-and-normal-people
The Speech impaired people(deaf and dumb) can not speak through the mouth but through their actions(Sign language). But normal people don't understand sign language. So this project aims to connect the normal people with speech impaired.
here, we are using python language and some libraries (mediapipe, opencv, speech-recognition, pyttsx3, pyAudio)
